# Position and Risk Management

Unlike spot market making, wherein for every trade made, an asset is received(for eg. for short SOL, we receive USDC and vice versa),
the same is not applicable for market making in derivatives. In perpetuals, especially, a new position is opened whenever a trade takes place.
This means that market makers would need to proactively manage these positions in order to extract the most value out of market making.

The easiest way of doing so is holding when the situation is preferable and settling the positions for positive Unrealized PnL.
However, what must be done when the conditions are unfavorable, i.e the market moves against a current position?

We apply risk management practices such as price intervals and thresholds. Meaning that, all open positions are settled at frequent intervals
in order to settle positive unrealized PnL and not hold any position for too long.

We will also be introducing dedicated logic to create more orders on the side of the orderbook that is set to receive funding payments,
than pay funding. Orders on the other side of the book will be unchanged, including their quantity. Only the quantity of orders on the receiving
side of the book will be marginally increased.

In order to monitor existing position's PnL, we use tick-by-tick and extremely fast read-writes from databases to make sure decision-making
is not delayed.
