# Position and Risk Management

Unlike spot market making, wherein for every trade made, an asset is received(for eg. for short SOL, we receive USDC and vice versa),
the same is not applicable for market making in derivatives. In perpetuals, especially, a new position is opened whenever a trade takes place.
This means that market makers would need to proactively manage these positions in order to extract the most value out of market making.

The easiest way of doing so is holding when the situation is preferable and settling the positions for positive Unrealized PnL.
However, what must be done when the conditions are unfavorable, i.e the market moves against a current position?

We apply risk management practices and delta neutral frameworks here to ensure that all positions are delta-neutral and any
loss incurred is thus minimized. Using settling periods and price thresholds, we make sure that positions are settled periodically
and any positions with extreme PnL are settled in advance.

Thus, by limiting losses and simultaneously mitigating them using delta-neutral frameworks, we ensure profitability at all times.

In order to monitor existing position's PnL, we use tick-by-tick and extremely fast read-writes from databases to make sure decision-making
is not delayed.
