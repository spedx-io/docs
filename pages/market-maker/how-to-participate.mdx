# How can one participate in SpedX Market Making?

Our end goal of developing the SpedX Market Maker was not only to bootstrap liquidity on Orderbooks, but also enabling a layman user
to market make on orderbooks. We enable this natively via Yield Avenues, which can be thought of as a vault that users can deposit into and earn yield.
Capital in the vault will be routed to market making via different strategies and users get yield based on the pro-rata share of their vault

Please do note that yield is not guaranteed and depends completely on the profits generated from market making. Hence, yield in many scenarios
can be negative, too. Although we hedge, hedging is a process to minimize losses, and not eliminate 6them. Please deposit at your own risk.
