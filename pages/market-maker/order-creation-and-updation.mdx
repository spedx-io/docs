# Order Updation

We utilize tick data of the market to not only make trading decisions, but also for the process of updating existing orders,
in order to either:

- Updating Pricing
- Updating Spreads

## Why tick data?

Financial markets move way too fast for manual human labour. Rapid computerization of trading has made human intervention redundant.
But is also requires algorithms to keep up with the market every few milliseconds, making it way hard for humans. We make use of tick
data to monitor the markets we are providing liquidity to, as well as other market whose data we are aggregating.

# Order Creation

We make sure that the number of orders are at par with the number of open positions. At start, the market maker has a few open orders
upto a specific spread, and no open positions. When the orders start getting filled, it starts creating more orders that scale semi-proportionately
with the number of open positions.
