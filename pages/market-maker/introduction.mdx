# Introduction

SpedX will be running it's native market maker to provide liquidity on the orderbooks. Although it might seem simple, it has a few unique
properties we're excited about

- Bootstrap liquidity on our / HxroNetwork's books.
- Make orderbooks great again, with increased liquidity and execution capacity.
- Allowing a layman user to market make on derivatives orderbooks without significant knowledge via Vaults.
- Eliminate Impermanent Loss for depositors with well thought out pricing and spread models.
- Enables advanced risk management via hedging, funding arbitrage, high-fidelity order updation and cancellation.
- Additionally, the portfolio-based cross margining system of HxroNetwork further boosts the capital efficiency.
- If successful, the market maker can be ported to other derivatives platforms, leveraging our partnerships with Zeta Markets.

# Properties of the Market Maker

## Primary Pricing and Volatility Models

In this model, we make use of candles of a specific period, say 15 min, for example, for 14 consecutive periods, in order to determine
a range in which the price was observed to be in the 14 15-min periods. This acts as a method of determining variance of the price over a given time period.
The time period is extremely crucial here, as we do not want to end up taking a small enough time frame that may over-represent volatility, nor do we want to take
a large enough time frame that may under-represent intraday volatility. Thus, we use a strip of timeframes that are designed to consider intra-hour,
intra-day and inter-day variances.

Using this estimation of variance / volatility, we also calculate our reservation price. Our reservation is a linear-volume-inverse-confidence-weighted-average-price.
This can be a mouthful, let's break it down. Our pricing engine aggregates prices from various sources, including Centralized as well as Decentralized Exchanges.
Then, it applies weights to each of these prices according to the volume done and the variance of the price offered by the exchange.

### Drawback of candlestick-based variance

The main drawback of candlestick-based variance systems is that they are not extenisble for determining variance of precise timeframes.
Using traditional forms of determining variance, such as Standard Deviations(we'll get to this later in this page), allows for determining
variance of sufficiently large timeframes without ignoring intraday variance, i.e they can be extrapolated to various timeframes.

Candlestick ranges limit this, as data, i.e candlestick data used to calculate a true-range of a price over a 14 X-min period cannot be extended to
calculate a true-range of the same price over a 14 Y-min period, wherein X & Y are different timeframes, like 15 minutes and a year.

## Secondary pricing and volatility model

This model acts as a sidekick, yet an independent model of arriving at variance and the reservation price. Here, the reservation price is simple,
it's a median of a dataset of all of the aggregated prices from the various data sources. A crucial detail to make note of here is that the dataset is not
simply just a dataset of current prices offered by various exchanges, but for every price obtained from a source, there are two separate prices, representing
the price minus and the price plus the candlestick variance divided by half. This subtle yet simple change allows the secondary pricing engine to be
cognisant of the varying levels of accuracy of the prices aggregated from various data sources.

The variance is a derivative of traditional variance models, and uses standard devations to arrive at variance. Like candlestick-based variance,
the Standard Devation too must be modelled to neither under-represent volatility, nor over-represent volatility. In practical sense, it is always better to
over-represent variance and quote wider, than under-representing variance and quoting tighter. The best example for this is EVM-based CEX-DEX arbitrage by
HFT block-builders. They are able to observe changes in Centralized markets and react to them in Decentralized markets faster than on-chain market makers,
who would have quoted tighter previously in their stale quotes. The end result is then obvious -- market makers get selectively picked off.
That is why, it's important to consider intraday variance, as well as interday variance, even in standard devations, along with combining variances of different
sources to arrive at a market-neutral variance, that is cognisant of Centralized market conditions, as well as Decentralized market conditions.

## Quoting on Orderbooks

The market maker would be quoting on derivatives orderbooks, such as SpedX / HxroNetwork and Zeta Markets. The market maker quotes at asymmetrical
spreads around the bid-ask spread and updates its quotes in an extremely frequent manner, such that it never misses minor price movements, as well as increased
in order-flow imbalance / variance, etc. The level of asymmetry of the spreads depends upon the levels of order-flow imbalance of the market.

## Capital Efficiency and Inventory Management

The market maker tries to strike a right balance between it's longs and shorts for two reasons: increased capital efficiency and low-risk profile of the entire portfolio.
Having a tight balance of longs and shorts means that the margining system, which looks at the portfolio as a whole, tends to make lesser initial margin requirements for new positions
as the portfolio is balanced, and has a very low delta profile. This leads to increased capital efficiency as sufficiently large positions can be opened at sufficiently low
initial margin requirements. This can also be applied to a very balanced and near-zero-delta portfolio, wherein all shorts offset longs, allowing the market maker to artificially hedge in the same
instrument itself.

## Liquidations and Funding Rate Exposure

The market maker separately runs a liquidation strategy along with it's set of market making strategies. The liquidation is simple, yet a bit complex.
The idea is to liquidate positions with insufficient margin, in return for a part of the collateral of the liquidatee. The way liquidations work in HxroNetwork,
as specified in [Liquidations](/dex-concepts/liquidations), positions with maintenance margin level below the threshold of
`1.5 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size` is opened to be liquidated by liquidators. The liquidation price is set to
`1 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size`. So, liquidators theoretically get the difference between the maintenance margin threshold
and the liquidation price as the reward, which is `0.5 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size`. This value is arrived at without considering any slippage,
that may affect the liquidation price and ultimately the collateral reward that the liquidator may make.

Thus, the liquidator client run by SpedX takes into consideration orderbook depth as well as orderbook depth recovery times in order to time
it's liquidations. Currently, we expect the liquidation capacity(measured by liquidation size and the time to liquidate it) to be extremely low
as we deal with slippage and low orderbook depth. However, we see this situation to improve as our market maker progressively adds liquidity to the books,
significantly improving the liquidation capacity of the liquidator.

Funding rate is yet another critical problem that the market maker faces. In it's pursuit to have a well balanced portfolio for capital efficiency
and drastically-reduced delta, it may end up paying as much as 20-30% of it's total APR in funding payments, thus reducing it's total APR by a lot.
Thus, in order to tackle this, the market maker not only sets significantly short amount of times for settlement of positions(in the factor of minutes),
but it also helps the market to achieve efficiency by arbitraging the funding rate and making back the theoretically lost APR.
