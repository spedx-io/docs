# Inventory Management

Effective management of market making inventory is absolutely necessary in situations wherein the unstable asset ends up
depreciating, decreasing the whole value of one's inventory. One of the major designs of Hxro Network is depositing collateral
and settling Unrealized PnL is denominated in USDC. This means that inventory can be denominated in USDC only, without requirement
of using other tokens for cross-collateral. This is beneficial as we do not require having unstable assets in our inventory.

However, this may be disadvantageous too. The basic disadvantage of using only USDC as collateral is the inability to truly
long one's longs. Meaning that, one can only benefit from the PnL thus received from opening a directional perpetuals position,
and not from the appreciation of the underlying asset, as he does not hold it. Holding the underlying asset and using it as collateral
enables a trader to truly long his long positions due to the possibility of PnL from opening the perpetuals position, as well as
appreciation of the underlying asset.

However, it is a tradeoff that one has to make while market making. Either use only stable collateral, make inventory management simpler
but end up losing on longing your longs, or use cross-collateral, make inventory management more complex, but be able to long your longs.
