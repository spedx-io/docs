# Position Settlement

We settle all open perpetuals positions periodically, in order to benefit from positive Unrealized PnL garnered from the positions.
It is also in order to adapt to the changing market and not to hold any perpetual position for too long.

The settlement interval varies perpetual to perpetual, as we take into account the volatility of a perpetual before deciding
the interval at which it should be settled. Meaning that more stable markets such as BTC would receive a **slightly** longer
settlement period compared to more volatile altcoins. The max settlement interval any market can receive is roughly 5-8 minutes
and there is no minimum number(Technically, the minimum number is the speed of the Solana blockchain itself).
