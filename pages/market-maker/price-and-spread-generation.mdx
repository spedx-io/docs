# Price Aggregation and Weightage

The Market Maker developed by us does not depend on the mark price of the Orderbook and uses an aggregation of prices from
a variety of sources to arrive at a concrete price.

After prices have been aggregated, we then apply a weightage by taking into consideration various factors such as volume, volatility
and liquidity. Volatility here is represented as a function of the NATR / Confidence Interval of the price.

# Spread Generation

The Market Maker quotes orders to the market at a algorithmically determined spread. This also takes into consideration various factors
such as liquidity, order flow toxicity and volatility.

This means that we are able to adjust our spreads every tick based on market conditions and the underlying liquidity of the market,
and are never exposed to phenomenons such as toxic order flow.
