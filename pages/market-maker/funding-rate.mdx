# Funding Rate

Funding rates in perpetuals are used to align the mark price of the perpetual contract with the index price. However, when
market making, we might have positions that may require us to pay funding rates. This may lead to us losing a sizeable chunk
from the total APR we can offer to our LPs. Thus, the market maker is inclined to create more orders on that side of the book
that is set to recieve funding for the current period. The orders on the side of the book that pays funding are left unchanged.
Meaning that, only the quantity of orders on the receiving side of the book are increased, whereas the quantity of orders of the
paying side of the book remain constant.

This is to ensure that the liquidity on one side of the book remains constant despite the inclination of the market maker to offset
a part of outgoing funding with incoming funding.
