# Extending Beyond ZDFs

ZDFs are our first step in introducing innovative trading products in the Solana DeFi ecosystem.

Our main standalone and prime product / instrument is Perpetuals, as they serve majority of the volume in derivatives.
ZDFs are HxroNetwork's and ultimately our venture into architecting safe market designs for trading of illiquid assets.
However, we do not want to stop there.

We have plans in our roadmap to issue derivative contracts for pre-launch spot assets. The main reason for speculation here
would be the price of the asset that is yet to be launched.
