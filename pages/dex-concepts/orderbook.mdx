# Orderbook

As a HxroNetwork ecosystem dApp, we utilize their Dexterity Orderbook. Dexterity is not your normal limit orderbook.
Dexterity is an Asset Agnostic Limit Orderbook with aggregated liquidity. This means that asset of any nature can be issued
as a MPG(see [MPG](/dex-concepts/mpg)) on HxroNetwork.

## What kind of aseets can one issue on HxroNetwork?

The aim of HxroNetwork is making listing of MPGs and ultimately new markets fully permissionless. The only requirement for listing
a new market is the presence of an oracle(Pyth Network, Switchboard or Custom) fetching the Index Price for a market.

Even assets such as forex and commodity derivatives can be issued on HxroNetwork thanks to it's Asset Agnostic Orderbook provided there
is an oracle providing constant price updates for the underlying asset.

## What is Aggregated Liquidity?

Think of DEX A and DEX B, both having their individual Orderbooks to support trading. Liquidity in such markets is fragmented, meaning
that order flow is tightly split into either DEX A or DEX B. More the number of DEXs, more the fragmentation of liquidity. Liquidity
fragmentation may also be directly linked to the rise of arbitrageurs and high-frequency traders primarily arbitrating between markets millions
of times in a day and earning the spread.

You might say aggregators like 1inch and Jupiter do the job, right? Such aggregators mostly act like order routes more than liquidity
aggregators, because liquidity is still not shared even with aggregators. In true aggregated liquidity, order flow on DEX A can access
liquidity on DEX B, thus ensuring seamless compatibility between DEXs, and no fragmentation. The only requirement here is, though,
that both DEX A and B must be built on the same layer that allows sharing of liquidity.
