# Collateral

How does one post collateral while trading in SpedX? The quantity of initial collateral, i.e initial margin is determined by
HxroNetwork's risk engine(see [Margining](/margining)), and margin is posted in $USDC. Meaning that, currently the only asset
that can be used to post collateral is USDC, although HxroNetwork is planning to expand collateral options to support cross-collateral
trading.

## Can Unrealized PnL be used as margin?

Yes! Traders can use their Unrealized PnL as margin for their existing positions. This means that positions that are highly overleveraged
or at the brink of liquidation can be saved by adding more collateral in the form of Unrealized PnL. However, we do realize that
that using paper(articial) profits as margin can be devastating in many cases, especially when those paper profits materialize into paper
losses and thus the collateral devalues incredibly. On how HxroNetwork manages this risk, see [Risk Management](/risk-management)
