# Oracles

Oracles are required for ascertaining the correct price of the underlying asset. With respect to ZDFs, Oracles provide the Index Price
at which all ZDF contracts settle to every 25 hours.

## Oracle Providers

We plan to utilize Pyth Network and Switchboard V3 oracles fetching the Index Prices for the required ZDF contracts at really
low-latency and blazing-fast speed.
