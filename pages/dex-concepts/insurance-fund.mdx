# Insurance Fund

An Insurance Fund acts as a solvency net for the protocol in the event of any bankrupt positions. Many a times, positions
may not be liquidated in time at their liquidation price and/or liquidators may not have enough capacity to liquidate them.
In such cases, the cash balance of these accounts falls below 0, meaning that sustained loss is more than the margin deposited.

The Insurance Fund then steps into pay off these liabilities and ensures that the protocol is liquid enough at all times in order
to pay out profitable positions.

## What are Bankrupt Positions?

Bankrupt Positions are those positions which have negative cash balance, indicating higher negative Unrealized PnL than the margin that
the account(for cross margin) or the position(for isolated margin) has deposited. Such cases arise mostly because these positions were not
liquidated in time at their zero price(liquidation price) and/or liquidators may not have enough capacity to liquidate them.

## How does the Insurance Fund operate?

As stated before, the Insurance Fund acts as a solvency net for the protocol by paying off excess liabilities of bankrupt positions
and ensuring that there is enough liquidity to pay off profitable positions. The Hxro Network has implemented an Insurance Fund mainly
denominated in USDC to cover the liabilities of bankrupt positions.

Margin currently is posted in USDC(see [Collateral](/dex-concepts/collateral)) and Exchange Fees are collected in USDC too(
see [Fees](/dex-concepts/fees)). Hence, the Insurance Fund is denominated in USDC as well. This USDC Insurance Fund is then used to pay off
liabilities in USDC.

Currently, users **CANNOT** deposit into the Hxro Network Insurance Fund yet. Thus, by default, all Insurance Funds on Hxro Network
are Isolated and not open for the public to deposit, and are funded exclusively using premiums.
