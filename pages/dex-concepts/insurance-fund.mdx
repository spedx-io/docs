# Insurance Fund

The SpedX Insurance Fund acts as a Backstop mechanism to handle over-levered positions with exceeding liability.
The Insurance Fund is responsible in covering any bankrupt positions.

## What are Bankrupt Positions?

Bankrupt positions are those positions who are extremely over-leveraged and their size is too much for a liquidator to handle.
Liquidators are also required to deposit margin in order to fulfil the initial margin requirements of the liquidated positions.
More the size, more the initial margin requirements. Thus, many liquidators will not be able to liquidate large positions because
of their inability to post sufficient margin. In such case, positions are declared as bankrupt.

Positions can be declared bankrupt also during volatile market conditions when positions may not be liquidated in time and their
real time balance goes below 0(i.e losses are greater than margin posted)

## What does the Insurance Fund do?

The Insurance Fund is used to pay off liabilities(losses) when the balances of the positions of the user goes below 0, and liquidators
are not able to liquidate those positions. In such a case, the Insurance Fund pays off those liabilities and ensures that users with
positive PnL insured. Thus, the Insurance Fund can be thought of an Insurance for the users with positive PnL when users with negative PnL
are not able to pay off their liabilities.

Every market has a limit upto which the Insurance Fund can cover the liabilities for a bankrupt position.

## How is the Insurance Fund funded?

The Insurance Fund is funded through deposits from users as well as the protocol. Users can stake their idle capital into the
Insurance Fund and can earn a portion of the liquidation penalties and trading fees. This capital is used to collateralize the liabilities
that the Insurance Fund will cover in case of bankrupt positions.

Currently, we have Insurance Fund denominated in USDC only, as collateral is accepted in USDC, and exchange fees are collected in USDC.
