# Insurance Fund

The SpedX Insurance Fund acts as a Backstop mechanism to handle over-levered positions with exceeding liability.
The Insurance Fund is responsible in covering any bankrupt positions.

## What are Bankrupt Positions?

Bankrupt positions are those positions who are extremely over-leveraged and their size is too much for a liquidator to handle.
Liquidators are also required to deposit margin in order to fulfil the initial margin requirements of the liquidated positions.
More the size, more the initial margin requirements. Thus, many liquidators will not be able to liquidate large positions because
of their inability to post sufficient margin. In such case, positions are declared as bankrupt.

Positions can be declared bankrupt also during volatile market conditions when positions may not be liquidated in time and their
real time balance goes below 0(i.e losses are greater than margin posted)
