# Liquidators

Liquidators are that segment of the market that free the protocol from potential bad-debt. The protocol allows traders and users
to open leveraged positions on derivatives products such as Perpetuals. This has many implications for the protocol, such as excess negative
Unrealized PnL devaluing the margin such that the positions become bankrupt and the protocol is left to pay for this bad-debt.

Liquidators take over margin accounts(called as TRGs, learn more about trading accounts [here](/dex-concepts/trg)), and cancel any open orders,
in an attempt to free up any margin that can be re-allocated to devaluing positions. In such a scenario, the user won't be able to place new orders
until his account is in the clear and the risky positions are now provided with enough buffer margin.

But, if the freed up margin from cancelling open orders still does not qualify the thresholds for maintenance margin, the position is opened up for
liquidation. Liquidators can call a specific liquidate instruction, which when successful is followed by a transfer of a set amount of assets and liabilities
from the liquidatee to the liquidator. The liquidator then progressively liquidates all liabilities in order to cover up for lack of margin. Any remaining
collateral remains with the trader.

The maintenance margin confiscated by the liquidator is not returned back to the trader. This is done in order to ensure minimum levels of profitability
and incentives for people to run liquidators. Liquidators get to keep the maintenance margin transferred from the liquidatee as a reward for liquidating,
and keeping the protocol debt-free.

Liquidators may also run advanced strategies in order to minimize the slippage while liquidating liabilities and ensure minimum acceptable capital
after liquidations that can be used to re-collateralize the liquidator. Please be aware that liquidators also need to put up margin in order to meet the margin
requirements of the thus acquired leverage.
