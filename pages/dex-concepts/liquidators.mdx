# Liquidators

Liquidators are that segment of the market which take over over-levered positions and sell them in the open market.
In the context of [Liquidations](/dex-concepts/liquidations), positions deemed healthy and unhealthy will not be liquidated.

Liquidators only liquidate those positions whose margin levels are below the maintenance margin levels, i.e liquidateable positions.
Liquidators earn rewards from liquidated collateral after every progressive liquidation. Liquidators liquidate positions in an algorithmic
fashion by looping through a list of accounts and finding those accounts whose health is deemed to be liquidateable. Then,
they take over all of those derivatives positions which are unhealthy and liquidate them. After liquidating them, liquidators receive
an asset at a discount as stated previously.

Please do note that liquidators also need to have TRGs setup and most have sufficient collateral in order to satisfy the initial margin
requirements of the inherited liabilities(liquidated positions). Also, liquidations always happen at the Oracle Price and not at the Mark Price
in order to prevent false and wacky prices being used to liquidate users.

If the liquidator is not able to handle the size of the liabilities, i.e he does not have sufficient margin, the positions are declared
to be bankrupt and the [Insurance Fund](/dex-concepts/insurance-fund) takes over them.
