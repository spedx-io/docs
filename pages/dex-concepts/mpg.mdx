# Market Product Groups (MPGs)

MPGs or Market Product Groups on HxroNetwork refer to a group of products that can be accessed via the MPG. Think of MPG A hosting
blue-chip perpetual contracts, whereas MPG B hosting altcoin ZDFs. To trade perpetuals, let's say, a trader account, would first have to connect
with the required MPG and then access the various products / markets to trade. Also, a trader account is directly linked to an MPG, and hence
cannot be used for any other MPG. For example, if a trader has created an account to trade perpetuals on MPG A, he cannot use the same account to trade
ZDFs on MPG B. To do so, he would have to create another account.

The same also applies for dApps like us building on Hxro. dApps have to connect with a specific MPG to offer products listed on that MPG.
For example, to offer perpetuals, a Hxro ecosystem dApp would have to connect via code with the desired MPG that consists of perpetuals.

In practice, MPGs may or may not be differentiated based on the products they list, as an MPG may also host perpetuals and expiry futures
and ZDFs as well. For specific use-cases, such as forex and commodity derivatives, one may also desire to create their own MPG with custom risk
parameters provided to the HxroNetwork risk engine.
