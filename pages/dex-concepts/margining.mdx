# How does Margining work on HxroNetwork / SpedX?

HxroNetwork Dexterity is a cross-margined derivatives orderbook, however in a different and realistic fashion.
Meaning that, margining on HxroNetwork is quite similar to how margining works in TradFi derivatives. Unlike allowing
traders to choose the leverage multiple at which they lever up, HxroNetwork pre-determines initial margin requirements
and thus the leverage using the volatility of the underlying portfolio. The formula for determining initial margin is
`3 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size`

Using such a margining method, HxroNetwork's risk engine ensures that a portfolio with a basket of volatile assets gets allocated
higher initial margin requirements and ultimately low leverage. This method is also suitable for more stable portfolio baskets like forex,
and thus HxroNetwork and ultimately SpedX can even offer Forex products with initial margin requirements as less as 0.1%(1000x leverage),
without posing significant risks to the protocol, because forex is a relatively stable asset basket.

# Important formulae

- Initial margin: `3 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size`
- Maintenance margin: `3/2 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size`
