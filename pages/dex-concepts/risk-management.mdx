# Risk Management

Risk Management is a crucial aspect with relation to derivatives in order to ensure that the protocol is always safe and resistant
from economic manipulation. One of the major steps taken in risk management by HxroNetwork is to ensure that too much of Unrealized PnL
cannot be used to post collateral, and too much of collateral cannot be withdrawn. Let's go over on how they achieve this.

## Capping Unrealized PnL

As understood from [Margining](/dex-concepts/margining), Unrealized PnL is counted as collateral for new positions just as USDC is(USDC is the only supported
form of collateral as of now, see [Collateral](/dex-concepts/collateral) for more information), the HxroNetwork risk engine ensures that too much of Unrealized PnL
cannot be withdrawn. The margin requirement ensures that when a trader is wanting to add to a profitable position, the margin requirement increases
with increase in size too. This would decrease the Unrealized PnL that can be withdrawn after increasing the position size. Why?
Because the Unrealized PnL before was counted as margin while adding to the position, hence decreasing the amount of new Unrealized PnL
after adding to the position.

## Orderbook marking

This risk management mechanism ensures that excess collateral cannot be withdrawn against positions that cannot be traded out.
Let's take an example to understand this. Suppose you longed the ZDF instrument SOL0D101322, which indicates the ZDF instrument for SOL.
Let's also assume that this position requires $250 worth of margin. In cases when you want to exit your position, the risk engine looks
at the Orderbook for bids for the amount of units of the instrument that you hold. Suppose the amount of bids for n units of SOL0D101322
that you hold is $500. This means that you would only be able to withdraw enough such that you receive $500 and not $250. In cases where the bids
for n units of that instrument is less than $250, you are still required to hold that $250.

The basic idea of doing this is to ensure that traders should not be able to withdraw Unrealized Pnl from positions that they can't fully close
otherwise.

## OI Caps

These Open Interest thresholds / caps are imposed at the TRG(see [TRG](/dex-concepts/trg)) level. Orders from a TRG would be blocked
if they ever breach a certain Open Interest threshold. These thresholds dont kick in until Open Interest on the overall contract reaches a specific
level. This is done in order to prevent the risk engine from classifying orders that normally do not prevent whale risk, but are relatively large with
respect to the contract's OI because the contract has just opened.

## Price bands

Price bands are used by the HxroNetwork risk engine in order to protect the users from market manipulation and from volatile events.
By definition, if the mark price of the market breaches a certain limit of the oracle's[see [Oracle](/dex-concepts/oracle) to see how we use Oracles]
TWAP, the market will prevent orders from filling until the mark price reverts within this band.

## Minimum cumulative order depth

Cumulative order depth minimum is a mechanism to calculate the mark price of a market. This is done in order to ensure that mark price
calculations are more conservative in thin markets wherein prices stay wacky almost always. Relaxation is given to markets with much more depth
as a culmination of diverse buyers and sellers ensures that the chances of price staying wacky is less probable.

## Required Minimum size

HxroNetwork's risk engine uses a parameter known as Minimum required order size, which requires traders and market makers to have their order sizes
above the limit set by the risk engine. This prohibits anyone from putting small, stale orders on the book in order to garner information from inbound
order flow that can be used on other venues for the purposes of frontrunning and arbitrage.
