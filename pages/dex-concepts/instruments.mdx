# What Kind of Instruments can I trade on SpedX / HxroNetwork?

Currently, we support trading of Perpetual Futures and Zero-Day Futures, with capacity to offer Expiry Futures, too, if we shall
see the demand.

## Perpetuals

Perpetuals are a category of Futures which let anyone to hold a position on an underlying asset forever, hence the name Perpetual.
This also means that they do not have any expiry. The user may choose to exit the position / may get liquidated, though.

## Zero-Day Futures

Zero-Day Futures or ZDFs are Futures instruments with a 25-hour expiry cycle, enabling short-term speculation on illiquid underlyings
(altcoins!). As Zero-Day Futures are new to crypto, we'll be going over them briefly.

- ZDFs are similar to 0DTEs in TradFi, but represent a future contract with a day to expiry.
- These are at-the-curve futures contracts, unlike Perpetuals.
- They are margined in USDC, and PnL payoff happens in USDC too.
- 24 hours of 25 are dedicated towards trading, whereas the additional hour is dedicated towards settlement.
- Positions are settled to cash automatically if they aren't rolled over to the next contract.
- There is **NO** funding rate component.
