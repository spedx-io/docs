# Trader Risk Groups (TRGs)

TRGs or Trader Risk Groups represent trader accounts on HxroNetwork and SpedX. A TRG is linked to a specific MPG. Meaning that a TRG linked
to an MPG can only access products listed on that MPG. For example, consider an MPG A consisting of only perpetuals. A TRG created for MPG A can only
access and trade perpetuals products, and not expiry futures or ZDFs that are not listed in MPG A.

A first-time trader on SpedX does not have to manage the painful process of creating an account, as that is done automatically with
the first deposit. In the future, we will have options to see existing TRGs while depositing in case traders are coming from other HxroNetwork dApps and have
TRGs already created.

We will also have a sleek UI to create TRGs, manage TRGs and change TRGs. In short, traders can create multiple TRGs, deposit between TRGs,
and change TRGs as well.
