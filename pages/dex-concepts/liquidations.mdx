# How do Liquidations work on SpedX?

Liquidations on SpedX / HxroNetwork work similar to other exchanges and is tied to margin. Liquidations occur when collateral posted
by a trader devalues / position overleverages. With regards to margining on Hxro, traders can either be in a healthy state, unhealthy state
or in a liquidateable state.

When the margin value of a trader's position equals `3 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size`, the trader's position is known to be a in a healthy state.
If the margin value of a trader's position is less than `3 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size` but more than `3/2 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size`,
the position is known to be in a unhealthy state. When the margin value of a trader's position is less than `3/2 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size`,
the position is known to be in a liquidateable state.

Positions that are in a liquidateable state are open to be liquidated by liquidators. Anyone can be a liquidator by running specific scripts
that scan through all accounts present on the DEX, and finds those that are in liquidateable state, and then proceeds to liquidate them. Please do
note that liquidating also requires depositing margin, so liquidator accounts must be funded too.
