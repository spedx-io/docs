# How do Liquidations work on SpedX?

Liquidations on HxroNetwork / SpedX work similar to other exchanges and are tied to margin. Hxro Network determines health of an account
using the following three ways:

- If the margin required for the position is above the threshold of `3 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size`, the account is considered to be
  extremely healthy.
- If the margin required for the position is exactly at the of `3 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size`, the account is considered to be
  healthy.
- If the margin required for the position is below the threshold of `3 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size`, but above the threshold of
  `3/2 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size`, the account is considered to be unhealthy.
- If the margin required for the position is below the threshold of `3/2 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size`, the account is considered to be
  liquidateable.

When the margin levels of an account dips below the `3/2 * 1d_standard_deviation * order_size`, the account is open for liquidation by liquidators.
Here is what may happen to your account once it is open for liquidation.

- If you have any open orders, they will be cancelled first. This ensures that any margin taken up by these set of orders is freed up and re-used for
  the liquidateable positions, thus potentially preventing them from getting liquidated. Please do note that you will not be able to send any more orders
  during this process that may take up more margin thus increasing the risk of liquidation even further. You are able to send new orders again
  once open orders have been cancelled and freed up margin has been added to liquidateable positions.
- However, if the margin is still below the maintenance margin requirements of the user's positions, positions are eligible to be liquidated
  by liquidators by sending a liquidation instruction. Learn more on how Liquidators function [here](/dex-concepts/liquidators). Liquidators specify
  a specific TRG to liquidate, the market and the size to be liquidated. Upon a successful execution of the liquidate instruction, the liquidator will trade
  with the liquidatee the positions to liquidate, at the _Index Price_ of the market at the time. For liquidating, the liquidator receives a fixed % of the
  liquidatee's collateral put up for maintenance margin as a reward.

## How to be safe from Liquidations?

Liquidations are a feature of sharp market movements and volatility. Although Hxro Network and SpedX try to mitigate risks of market manipulation and sudden
wicks within the protocol causing unfair liquidations by using the Index Price to dictate liquidations and not the Mark Price, there is always a chance of underlying
market volatility especially in long-tail markets. Thus, always be vigilant while trading leveraged products such as Perpetuals and ZDFs!
Always manage your risks using stop-loss orders and ensuring there is enough margin available and you are not overleveraging beyond your appetite
