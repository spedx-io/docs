# Socialized Loss

Socialized Loss is an Anti-deleveraging mechanism where excess losses sustained on the platform are socialized across
the positions of all users. For derivatives traders, losses are distribured based on the pro-rata amount of all their open
positions. Meaning that, more the position value, including Unrealized PnL, more of the socialized loss will be allocated to that
position.

This ensures that even though a socialized deleveraging process happens, positions with relatively small positive PnL or small
negative PnL are not shoved to the boundaries of liquidation.

## When will Socialized Loss take place?

Socialized Loss only occurs when the levered losses sustained within a particular market are greater than the liquidity in the
market's Insurance Fund. Another way to think of this is Socialized Loss takes place if the deleveraging process carried out by the
Insurance Fund is not enough to ease the liabilities of overleveraged positions.

## Note

Socialized Loss is specific to a market. Meaning that, if there is excess bad debt in the BTCUSD-PERP market, such that even the Insurance
Fund cannot delever it, losses will be Socialized. But, this process would only be specific to traders having positions in the BTCUSD-PERP market.
So if anyone is trading the ETHUSD-PERP market in the above example, they will not be affected by this process.
