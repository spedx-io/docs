# SpedX Yield Avenues

SpedX will be utilizing a bunch of yield avenues, in order to attract idle liquidity that typically rests on AMMs.
The main idea is for the users to deposit into initiatives such as the [Market Maker](/market-maker), [Liquidator Client](/liquidators) and the [Insurance Fund](/insurance-fund)
and capture yield according to their pro-rata share in the total pool.

## How do Yield Avenues work?

Users can access Yield avenues, which in simpler terms can be thought of as capital vaults run and maintained by SpedX, from the SpedX UI itself.
To access yield avenues and deposit liquidity, head over to [zdfs.spedx.exchange/yield](zdfs.spedx.exchange/yield). Choose the specific
vault that you want to deposit to[Work-In-Progress, not live yet], connect your wallet, select the desired amount and click on deposit.
That amount is then deposited to the respective vault, and the protocol on the backend records your pro-rata share of the vault as well as
the profit growth(which initially is nil).

## How does profit distribution work?

Users receive a share of the profit according to their pro-rata share of the vault. When they try to withdraw their funds, they receive the initial principal
amount + any profit made or loss incurred. When they deposit initially, the profit growth would be nil. Proceeding that, the underlying algorithm
utilizes the newly deposited funds for the activity it performs(market making, liquidating or insuring collateral). Results from these activities
whether profit or loss is reflected in the UI. The underlying algorithms tend to recycle the profit made from operations, so the profit growth is compounded
by definition. The APR/APY shown in the UI represents the profit growth obtained by the algorithm in it's operations. Note that profit growth
can be either negative or positive, depending on the strategy, risk, and the market condition that the algorithm is operating in.

## Insurance Fund -- The exception

One of the yield avenues that SpedX exposes a protocol-run vault is the Insurance Fund. In short, the SpedX Insurance Fund covers
collateral / bad debts of positions that otherwise could not be liquidated / covered by liquidators. Thus, it makes sure that all positions
remain fully backed / covered.

But, it is worth to notice that the Insurance Fund by definition does not make money from it's operations. So you might ask, how does it
pay its depositors? Depositors depositing into the Insurance Fund vault get a share of the fees collected by SpedX from it's exchange activities.
Currently, SpedX charges 0bps for maker orders and 5bps for taker orders(see [Fees](/dex-concepts/fees) for more information), all of which flows to HxroNetwork
and $HXRO stakers. Additionally, we will implement a fee(1-2bps, see [Fees](/dex-concepts/fees) for more information) on top of the base taker
fee which will flow to SpedX, using which we will fund Insurance Fund yield payoffs.
