# SpedX Yield Avenues

The main idea of the SpedX Market Maker is not only to improve liquidity on orderbooks, but also enable a layman user to provide graded liquidity
on Orderbooks, without actually having sufficient knowledge of the processes. Furthering this, users will be able to deposit into the market maker
to participate in market making activities on SpedX / HxroNetwork via a Vault-based system. Let's dive into the details

## Making a deposit

When the market maker goes live for the public, we will expose an interface via our UI enabling direct deposits into the market maker's inventory.
Meaning that, the market maker will utilize funds from this vault to market make on the orderbooks directly. Initially, users will only be able to make a
deposit using $USDC, which is the protocol's margining and PnL-payoff token. However, as HxroNetwork progressively adds cross-collateral mechanisms, users can deposit
to the market maker using a variety of token choices.

## APR Specifications

We want to make depositing into the vault as seamless as possible, all the while maintaining transparency. Depositors will be able to see live APR provided by the market maker,
as well as it's tick-by-tick activity information, such as Active Positions, Active Orders, Funding Payments, Funding Receipts, Available Margin, etc, all via the Vault UI.
Please do note that APR is always fluctuating and can be negative, unlike traditional AMM mechanisms, where constant fees guarantee some form of return.
However, unlike AMMs, the SpedX market maker experiences near-zero Impermanent Loss due to it's cross-venue cognisance as well as low-latency
trading mechanism.

## Withdrawals

Users are able to withdraw their full deposited capital +- any profit/loss made by the market maker using the user's capital at any point in time.
In the case of losses, the users get back less than their deposited capital, as the user's capital was used to pay-off losses according to the pro-rata share
of the user in the vault in terms of total capital. In the case of the profit, the users get back more than their deposited capital, as the market maker proceeds to settle
it's profitable trades using which it pays-off users based on their pro-rata share of the vault.

## transparency

As stated before, the market maker will be fully transparent from the ground-up. Depositors as well as non-depositors can observe the operations of the market maker,
that is fully algorithmic. Important statuses such as Active Positions, Active Orders, etc, across markets and instruments can be observed from a single terminal.
Users can even view the on-chain data of each specific information, if need be.

# Liquidator Yield Avenues

Alongside market making, SpedX will also be running a public liquidator client to de-leverage positions. As in market making wherein deposited capital
is used to post margin and/or settle any potential losses, the deposited capital in a liquidator vault would be used to post margin, that is a pre-cursor to liquidating.
As also in market making, wherein the major risk is the market moving on the other side of your positions, one of the major risks in liquidations is slippage,
that can potentially decrease the collateral reward provided to the liquidator by the protocol for liquidating the liquidatee.
