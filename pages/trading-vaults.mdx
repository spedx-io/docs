# Trading Vaults

Trading vaults are an extension of [Yield Avenues](/yield-avenues). One can think of them as a permissionless version of Yield Avenues,
wherein anyone can create their own vault, garner deposits purely based on their strategy and performance(PnL), and trade on SpedX with the
thus deposited money.

Similar to Yield Avenues, depositors earn profit made as per the pro-rata share of their deposits in the vault. Everything is
permissionless starting from vault creation, deposits, vault management and using the funds to trade. In short, you can become the fund
manager you've always wanted to become, but on a micro level. However, the protocol enforces some minimum constraints in order to prevent
stealing of funds by the vault creator / depositors(withdrawing excess of what they deposited + profit or loss).

## Vault creation

Anyone that is connected to SpedX, and has a TRG(see [trg](/dex-concepts/trg) for more) created already can create a trading vault of their own.
And, to ensure skin in the game and accountability, the share of the vault owner in the total vault must always be at a minimum of 10%. Meaning that,
he who is creating a vault is not only the vault leader / fund manager, but also a micro depositor in it. And if the vault leader tries
to withdraw capital from the vault that puts his share of the vault below 10%, the action would be voided.

## Vault management

Trading vaults are fully permissionless meaning that vault leaders / fund managers are free to use these in funds in any form of trading activities,
with no restriction from the protocol-side. Meaning that, a vault leader can run market making strategies, directional strategies, liquidator strategies,
or any strategy that he wishes to do.

## Protocol-enforced constraints

The only constraint enforced by the protocol is the withdrawal of deposited assets, in order to ensure that the vault leader, driven by his
malicious motivations, does not steal user funds, or a user does not withdraw amount in the excess of principal amount + profit/loss.

## Algorithmic trading

Traders / vault leaders will be provided with algorithmic access to the trading vault, that they can use to link with their algorithmic trading strategy.
Meaning that, traders can algorithmically deposit funds into a TRG(see [Accounts](/dex-concepts/accounts) for more) and trade with the deposited money.

## UI-based trading

As a fund manager / vault trader would typically have a TRG specially dedicated for the trading vault while trading algorithmically, the same applies
to using the vault funds to trade via SpedX UI. Meaning that, the way TRGs need a pubkey acting as the depositor / withdrawer to the TRG, the trading vault would
act as the depositor and withdrawer to the TRG using which the vault leader would trade using vault money. Thus, whenever a trader
creates their own trading vault, the protocol automatically creates a TRG linked with the trading vault for deposit and withdrawal purposes.

## Dissolution of a vault

A trader may choose to dissolve / end their trading vault irrespective of the reasons. In such a scenario, all of the user deposits + any profit/loss
are withdrawn automatically and distributed back to the vault depositors. The vault manager does get to keep his share of the vault, though.
