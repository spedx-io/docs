# Introduction

SpedX is a DEX being built on Solana that focuses on offering optimal liquidity, execution and best-in-class UX to it's traders.

## Why?

Imagine a scenario, you are a shitcoin trader on Ethereum, trading popular coins like $LINK, $WLD, $RLB, $LDO, etc on EVM DEXs.
One day, a big NFT mint happens on the L1. Gas prices skyrocket. Even L2s feel the effect. At the same time, you spot a winning trade
in a shitcoin. But the gas price is more than the notional value of your trade. You miss out on an obvious and money-making trade.

We all have been through this experience. All of us, at some point in our lives have traded, or trade shitcoins. However, the inability of
the EVM to facilitate smooth trading experiences acts as a limiting factor.

Another problem is lack of consistent liquidity. Market makers typically hesitate to provide liquidity to derivatives of shitcoins, mainly
due to non-uniform settlement. In perpetuals, settlement is not uniform, meaning that some people are left holding the bags at the last. Expiry future
markets are not yet widely used in crypto, mainly due to the added complexity of long-term uncertain speculation.

One could say that bridging of shitcoins to faster chains like Solana could be a solution. But, bridging is an extremely time consuming and expensive process.
Bridges also have a history of exploits mainly due to the wrapping of assets. Speeding up the bridging process involves a certain level of centralization
which is against the basic premise of blockchains, which is trust minimization.

Lastly, even if one was to bridge their favorite shitcoins to faster chains like Solana and were to find a market for it,
bad actors in the markets tend to manipulate the prices of perpetual contracts of illiquid shitcoins, and then farm funding rate rewards.
This causes a disparity and inefficiency in the market where the Mark Price tends to be wacky most of the time, and traders are forced to trade at
inefficient prices.

## What?

Thus, to solve the problem of slow and expensive chains, time-consuming bridging process, lack of market makers for liquidity and presence
of bad actors manipulating thin markets, we are bringing forth a new instrument, known as Zero-day Futures that enable short-term, liquid margin trading
of shitcoins, without the actual asset being on the chain itself, with no funding rates, and the contract design acting as an incentive to market makers.

ZDFs portray the following features:

- Enable short-term liquid margin trading of any underlying asset.
- All ZDF contracts expire every 25 hours.
- 24 hours is meant for trading, and the additional 1 hour is for settlement of contracts
- There is no funding rate as all contracts settle to Index Price at expiry.
- No bridging is required, as margin is paid and contracts settle in USDC.

Advantages of ZDFs for Traders are:

- No funding rate
- No bridging requirement
- Ability to access leverage by posting collateral
- Despite manipulation risks, they incur guaranteed cash settlement at index price.

Advantages of ZDFs for Market Makers are:

- Ability to manage risk using advanced measures
- Guaranteed settlement ensuring that they are not left with the bags at the end
- Flexibility to settle to cash or roll over to the next contract depending on risks
- Provide liquidity to the long tail of assets by leveraging at-the-money futures

### Important Information
