# Introduction

SpedX is a DEX being built on Solana that focuses on offering optimal liquidity, execution and best-in-class UX to it's traders.

## What?

SpedX is a DEX focusing on four things: optimal liquidity, the right set of incentives, increased capital efficiency and best-in-class UX.
We're building on the learnings accumulated by our team by trading on decentralized venues. We're bringing forth an asset-agnostic orderbook,
powered by HxroNetwork, coupled with a market maker to add liquidity to the orderbook in a continuous fashion.

## Why?

As traders, we feel the pain of getting slipped numerous times while trading on Orderbooks. The principle reason for slippage is lack of liquidity
on Orderbooks. Liquidity on Orderbooks is mainly supplied by Market Makers. Market Makers are that segment of a market that post bids and asks
on both sides of the book and establish liquidity in the market, allowing anyone to buy and sell various quantities of assets at the price they desire.
DeFi and specifically on-chain derivatives exchanges lack market making activity mainly because market makers are reluctant to provide liquidity due to
smart contract risks, economic risks, lack of understanding of blockchain tech, and mainly, lack of volume in decentralized markets.

Market Makers desire volume before deploying liquidity. Traders, who bring the volume, desire liquidity before trading. Thus, it's a chicken and egg problem,
that is pretty tough to solve. Following this, pretty interesting models of exchanges have popped up. GMX is the best example by a mile.
GMX uses a liquidity pool rather than an orderbook as the main trading avenue. Traders are allowed to open positions against the liquidity pool,
and the liquidity pool fully collateralizes these positions using the liquidiy in the pool itself. However, such implementations have a few flaws:

- Models like GMX survive on a thin rope called fees. Because the pool always takes the opposite position as traders, any profit for the pool is derived off
  of traders making losses on their positions. However, when traders make profit, the pool looses heavily. In order to make up for this and offer LPs
  a competitive yield on their liquidity, GMX implements a fee model that charges traders orders of magnitude higher than orderbooks.
- There is no backstop liquidity source for pool-to-peer models, as they are meant to be "the" source of liquidity. In orderbooks, market makers
  themselves are the backstop liquidity source, and models like Drift implement a native vAMM as the Backstop Liquidity Source.
- Funding rates can be badly understood. Funding rates in Orderbooks are a function of the deviation between the mark price and the index price.
  However, in a liquidity pool model, funding rates are a function of the inventory skew held by the liquidity pool. This makes funding
  rates incrediblt predictable and incredibly volatile in the case of poorly managed inventory and sub-park risk management.

## How?

We leverage Hxro Network's Derivatives infrastructure to power trading of different instruments. Upon this, we embed an off-chain market maker to provide
liquidity to the orderbooks. The orderbook acts as the main trading avenue, whereas the market maker acts as a liquidity source by adding liquidity to the orderbook.
